# Security

If you find a security issue with Mutagen, please DO NOT submit it via the issue
tracker! Instead, please follow responsible disclosure practices and send
information about security issues directly to
[security@mutagen.io](mailto:security@mutagen.io) so that a proper assessment
can be made and a fix prepared before a wide announcement. You will receive an
acknowledgement within 24 hours. If you do not, please contact the project
maintainer directly at [jacob@havoc.io](mailto:jacob@havoc.io).

Even in cases where you have limited or incomplete information, or you're not
sure whether or not a problem constitutes a security issue, please make contact
as soon as possible. We can work together to investigate, debug, and assess.

You may also direct questions, feedback, or suggestions about Mutagen's security
policy to the same email addresses.

Your help is greatly appreciated in keeping Mutagen secure!

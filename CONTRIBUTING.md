# Contributing

Mutagen is still at an early stage of development work where the best forms of
contribution are testing, feedback, and issue reports. Experience reports with
integrating Mutagen into your workflow, as well as information about new
workflows which it might enable, are especially welcome.

At this point in time, pull requests are not particularly helpful due to the
significant amount of ongoing development work. Feature requests in particular
are better submitted as issues to be discussed and reviewed before spending your
valuable time implementing them. As Mutagen matures, pull requests will become
an important part of its continued development, so stay tuned!
